# SciRooPlot
SciRooPlot is a [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root)-based plotting framework that facilitates creating and organizing the plots arising in scientific data analyses.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights

- define publication-ready plots with only a few lines of code
- intuitively handle data from multiple input files and substructures therein
- centrally organize and manage all of your plots
- fast access via a command-line application

## ðŸŽ¯ Target group
This software is made for scientists working with ROOT data, who:
- are tired of the ever-increasing amount of single-purpose plotting macros that accumulate over the years
- simply want to draw their data without having to deal with technical details and peculiarities of ROOT
- miss an intuitive and straightforward interface to define a plot
- long for a lasting solution to organize and keep track of the many plots that arise in the course of their work
- appreciate useful additional plotting functionality that enhances productivity

SciRooPlot aims to address these day-to-day plotting requirements such that analyzers can focus on their science instead of wasting time with plotting technicalities.
Ideas, suggestions, and code contributions to this open-source project are very welcome.
