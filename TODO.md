- add marker/line transparency
- replace AddRefFunc with user-defined functions that can be modified
- check if box auto-size determination considers that legend entries may have different text sizes
- add default-boxes (legend and text) that will be baseline for all boxes of this pad
- add flexible margins for the boxes
- make width of marker column in legend box user definable
- fully support csv format (flexible string and delimiter)
- decide where data manipulation part should be put (before or after setting ranges?)
- should smoothing be done before or after division for ratios (or both)??
- SetOption(string) does not override SetOption(defaultOption)
- if same histogram is added to plot twice, the name is no longer unique and this results in unwanted behavior for ref data specified in legend entries
- csv w/o options -> invisible -> TGraphErrors has wrong defaults
- support TGraphAsymmErrors
- add division hist/graph, graph/hist

- focus inintroduction only on the intended usage
- double-check that scripts work if no project is active
- inform that output dir must be set manually if needed
- add help in plot app
